# Ascension Lending Group ( Mock Next.js/Postgres Full Stack Application )

This is a Lending Application currently in development. I am using Next.js 14, TailwindCSS, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. The first phase of this project is 3/4 of the way completed with Next.js and Next-Auth being wired to the PostgreSQL Database via Prisma/Prisma Client. As of now the application only saves the User's login information to the Users Table in the Database. Not all routes have been created, and the styling is very minimal and focused only on the mobile view until later.

The inteded product upon completion will be a full on end-to-end fintech application with data relationships and converted into a PWA (Progressive Web Application).
